          The Power of Beginning
        </h3>

        <p class="text-[11px] md:text-[17px] lg:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The hardest part of any creative endeavor is often taking that first step. Don't wait for perfect conditions or inspiration to strike. Just start.<br><br>

          Every great community, every masterpiece, every breakthrough began with someone deciding to just start. It's in the act of beginning that we find our momentum and direction.<br><br>

          <strong>Consider this your official permission slip:</strong> You have permission to get started. We permission you.<br><br>

          We live by the idea that "You don't have to be married to the format, you're married to what works." The point is to engineer a feeling - the feeling of being excited about what's possible, and relief that you've found kind, curious people to share the potential with.<br><br>

          Your first session doesn't have to be flawless. It probably won't be. That's okay. The magic of Socratica isn't in perfection, it's in the consistent creating and the friendships formed.<br><br>

          By taking that first step, you're not just starting a node. You're creating a space where ideas can flourish, where people can find their tribe, and where the seeds of future innovations are planted.<br><br>

          You're contributing to a world where consistently creating things with friends becomes an obvious part of the broader social fabric.<br><br>
          Ready to begin? Here are some first steps:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-none text-[11px] md:text-[17px] lg:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 space-y-4">
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="mr-4 font-bold">1.</span>&nbsp;
            <span><strong>Find a space:</strong> It doesn't have to be perfect. An unlocked classroom, a building lobby, or a park can work. The most important thing is gathering great people together.</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="mr-4 font-bold">2.</span>&nbsp;
            <span><strong>Set a date:</strong> Choose a day and time. It doesn't have to be far in the future. Next week is perfect.</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="mr-4 font-bold">3.</span>&nbsp;
            <span><strong>Invite people:</strong> Start with your friends. Reach out to that acquaintance who's always talking about their side project. Remember, two people is a gathering.</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="mr-4 font-bold">4.</span>&nbsp;
            <span><strong>Plan a simple structure:</strong> Introduction circles, snacks, work session, demos. Keep it basic for your first meeting.</span>
          </li>
          <li class="flex items-start">
            <span class="mr-4 font-bold">5.</span>&nbsp;
            <span><strong>Show up:</strong> This is the most important step. Be there, ready to welcome others and create together.</span>
